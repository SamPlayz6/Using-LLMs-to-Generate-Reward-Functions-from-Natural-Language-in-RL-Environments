Function Input:\n   - `observation`: This is likely a tuple or list containing the current state of the environment.\n   - `action`: The action taken by the agent (though not used in this specific function).\n\n2. Unpacking the Observation:\n   `x, _, angle, _ = observation`\n   - `x`: The horizontal position of the cart.\n   - `angle`: The angle of the pole from vertical (in radians).\n   - The underscores (`_`) suggest that there are two other values in the observation that are not used in this function.\n\n3. Base Reward Calculation:\n   `reward = 1.0 - abs(angle) - 0.5 * abs(x)`\n   - Starts with a base reward of 1.0.\n   - Subtracts the absolute value of the angle.

It also teaches the agent to prioritize keeping the pole upright over keeping the cart perfectly centered, as the angle has a larger impact on the reward than the position."}}
