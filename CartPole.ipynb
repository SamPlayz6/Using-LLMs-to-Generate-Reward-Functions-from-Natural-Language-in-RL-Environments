    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def LLMOutput(observation, action):\n",
    "    x, _, angle, _ = observation\n",
    "    reward = 1.0 - abs(angle) - 0.5 * abs(x)\n",
    "    return max(0, reward)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Input:\n",
    "   - The function takes two parameters: `observation` and `action` (although `action` is not used in this function).\n",
    "   - `observation` is assumed to be a tuple or list containing four elements, but only the first (x) and third (angle) are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Unpacking the observation:\n",
    "   - `x, _, angle, _` = observation\n",
    "   - This line extracts the position (x) and angle from the observation. The underscores (_) indicate that we're ignoring the second and fourth elements of the observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Calculating the reward:\n",
    "   - `reward = 1.0 - abs(angle) - 0.5 * abs(x)`\n",
    "   - The reward starts at 1.0 and is reduced based on two factors:\n",
    "     a. The absolute value of the angle: This penalizes the pole for leaning away from vertical.\n",
    "     b. Half the absolute value of the position: This penalizes the cart for being far from the center.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The logic behind this reward calculation:\n",
    "   - The goal is to keep the pole upright (angle close to 0) and the cart near the center (x close to 0).\n",
    "   - A larger angle or distance from center results in a lower reward.\n",
    "   - The angle has a stronger impact on the reward than the position (full weight vs. half weight).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Returning the reward:\n",
    "   - `return max(0, reward)`\n",
    "   - This ensures the reward is never negative. If the calculated reward is negative, 0 is returned instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, this function calculates a reward based on how well the pole is balanced (angle) and how centered the cart is (x). The reward is highest (close to 1) when the pole is perfectly upright and the cart is in the center. It decreases as the pole leans more or the cart moves farther from the center, with the angle having a stronger influence on the reward than the position.\n",

    "   - `observation` is unpacked into four variables, but only `x` and `angle` are used.\n",
    "   - `x` represents the cart's position.\n",

      "Certainly! This function is a custom reward function for the Cart-Pole balancing problem. Let's break down the logic behind it:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Input:\n",
      "   - `observation`: A tuple containing the current state of the environment (x, x_dot, angle, angle_dot)\n",
      "   - `action`: The action taken (not used in this function)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Unpacking the observation:\n",
      "   `x, _, angle, _ = observation`\n",
      "   - `x`: The position of the cart\n",
      "   - `angle`: The angle of the pole (in radians)\n",
      "   - The other two values (velocity and angular velocity) are ignored in this function\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Basic reward calculation:\n",
      "   `reward = 1.0 - abs(angle) - 0.5 * abs(x)`\n",
      "   - Start with a base reward of 1.0\n",
      "   - Subtract the absolute value of the angle (encourages keeping the pole upright)\n",
      "   - Subtract half the absolute value of the position (encourages keeping the cart centered)\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Penalty for extreme states:\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   if abs(angle) > 0.2 or abs(x) > 2.4:\n",
      "       reward -= 10\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "   - If the angle is too large (> 0.2 radians or about 11.5 degrees) or the cart is too far from the center (> 2.4 units), apply a large penalty of -10\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Return the calculated reward\n",
      "\n",
      "The logic behind this reward function is:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Encourage upright position: The more vertical the pole (smaller angle), the higher the reward.\n",
      "2. Encourage centered position: The closer the cart is to the center (x = 0), the higher the reward.\n",
      "3. Balanced priorities: The angle is given full weight, while the position is given half weight, indicating that keeping the pole upright is more important than keeping the cart centered.\n",
      "4. Avoid extremes: There's a large penalty for letting the pole tilt too far or letting the cart move too far from the center, which would likely result in failure.\n",
      "\n",
      "This reward function aims to teach the agent to balance the pole by keeping it as upright as possible and the cart as centered as possible, with a strong disincentive for reaching extreme states that would end the episode.\n",
