Unpacking the Observation:\n   `x, _, angle, _ = observation`\n   - `x`: The horizontal position of the cart.\n   - `angle`: The angle of the pole from vertical (in radians).\n   - The underscores (`_`) indicate that we're ignoring two other values in the observation.\n\n3. Base Reward Calculation:\n   `reward = 1.0 - abs(angle) - 0.5 * abs(x)`\n   - Starts with a maximum reward of 1.0.\n   - Subtracts the absolute value of the angle.

Encourage keeping the cart as close to the center as possible (minimizing `x`).\n3. Heavily penalize states that are close to failure (large angles or cart positions).\n\nThis reward structure guides the learning algorithm to find a policy that balances the pole effectively while keeping the cart within bounds. The continuous nature of the reward (rather than just binary success/failure) provides more nuanced feedback to the learning process, allowing for gradual improvement in performance."}}
