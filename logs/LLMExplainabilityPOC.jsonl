This stability reward function is designed to encourage the cart-pole system to maintain a stable, upright position. Let's break down the function and explain how each component contributes to the goal of stability:\n\n1. Input:\n   - The function takes two parameters: `observation` and `action`.\n   - The `observation` is unpacked into four variables: `x`, `xDot`, `angle`, and `angleDot`.\n   - `x`: Position of the cart\n   - `xDot`: Velocity of the cart\n   - `angle`: Angle of the pole from vertical\n   - `angleDot`: Angular velocity of the pole\n\n2. Angle Stability Component:\n   ```python\n   angle_stability = 1.0 - abs(angle) / 0.209\n   ```\n   - This component focuses on the angle of the pole.\n   - The absolute value of the angle is used to treat deviations in either direction equally.\n   - The angle is normalized by dividing it by 0.209 (approximately 12 degrees). This value is likely chosen based on the maximum allowed angle in the environment.\n   - Subtracting from 1.0 inverts the scale, so a smaller angle results in a higher reward.\n   - This component encourages the pole to stay as close to vertical (0 degrees) as possible.\n\n3. Angular Velocity Component:\n   ```python\n   angular_velocity_component = -abs(angleDot) / 10.0\n   ```\n   - This component focuses on the angular velocity of the pole.\n   - The absolute value of `angleDot` is used to penalize any rapid movement, regardless of direction.\n   - Dividing by 10.0 scales the penalty to be in a similar range as the angle stability component.\n   - The negative sign makes this component a penalty: higher angular velocities result in lower (more negative) rewards.\n   - This component encourages the pole to move slowly, reducing oscillations and promoting stability.\n\n4. Combining Components:\n   ```python\n   return float(angle_stability + angular_velocity_component)\n   ```\n   - The two components are added together to produce the final reward.\n   - The `float()` function ensures the result is a floating-point number.\n\nWhy this function focuses on stability:\n\n1. It only considers the angle and angular velocity of the pole, ignoring the cart's position and velocity. This shows a clear focus on the pole's stability rather than the cart's movement.\n\n2. The angle stability component rewards keeping the pole close to vertical, which is the primary goal for stability in this system.\n\n3. The angular velocity component penalizes rapid movements of the pole, which could lead to instability or oscillations.\n\n4. By combining these components, the function encourages actions that keep the pole upright (angle close to 0) and moving slowly (low angular velocity), which are key factors for maintaining stability in the cart-pole system.\n\n5. The function does not reward or penalize the cart's position or velocity, allowing the system to focus solely on keeping the pole balanced, regardless of where the cart is on the track.\n\nThis reward function guides the learning algorithm to prioritize actions that maintain the pole's stability, which is the primary challenge in the cart-pole problem."}}
