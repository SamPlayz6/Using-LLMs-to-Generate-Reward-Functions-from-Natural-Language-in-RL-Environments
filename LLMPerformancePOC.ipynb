    "```python\n",
    "def LLMOutput(observation, action):\n",
    "    x, _, angle, _ = observation\n",
    "    reward = 1.0 - abs(angle) - 0.5 * abs(x)\n",
    "    return max(0, reward)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Input:\n",
    "   - The function takes two parameters: `observation` and `action` (although `action` is not used in this function).\n",
    "   - `observation` is assumed to be a tuple or list containing four elements, but only the first (x) and third (angle) are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Unpacking the observation:\n",
    "   - `x, _, angle, _` = observation\n",
    "   - This line extracts the position (x) and angle from the observation. The underscores (_) indicate that we're ignoring the second and fourth elements of the observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Calculating the reward:\n",
    "   - `reward = 1.0 - abs(angle) - 0.5 * abs(x)`\n",
    "   - The reward starts at 1.0 and is reduced based on two factors:\n",
    "     a. The absolute value of the angle: This penalizes the pole for leaning away from vertical.\n",
    "     b. Half the absolute value of the position: This penalizes the cart for being far from the center.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The logic behind this reward calculation:\n",
    "   - The goal is to keep the pole upright (angle close to 0) and the cart near the center (x close to 0).\n",
    "   - A larger angle or distance from center results in a lower reward.\n",
    "   - The angle has a stronger impact on the reward than the position (full weight vs. half weight).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Returning the reward:\n",
    "   - `return max(0, reward)`\n",
    "   - This ensures the reward is never negative. If the calculated reward is negative, 0 is returned instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, this function calculates a reward based on how well the pole is balanced (angle) and how centered the cart is (x). The reward is highest (close to 1) when the pole is perfectly upright and the cart is in the center. It decreases as the pole leans more or the cart moves farther from the center, with the angle having a stronger influence on the reward than the position.\n",

    "   - `observation` is unpacked into four variables, but only `x` and `angle` are used.\n",

      "- The goal is to keep the pole upright (small angle) and the cart near the center (small x).\n",
      "- The reward is highest when both the angle and x are close to zero.\n",
      "- As the pole tilts more or the cart moves further from the center, the reward decreases.\n",
