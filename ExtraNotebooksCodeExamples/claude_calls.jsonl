Let's break down the logic behind this dynamic reward function:\n\n1. Function inputs:\n   - `observation`: A tuple containing the current state of the environment\n   - `action`: The action taken (not used in this particular function)\n\n2. Unpacking the observation:\n   `x, _, angle, _ = observation`\n   - `x`: The horizontal position of the cart\n   - `angle`: The angle of the pole (in radians, presumably)\n   - The underscores (`_`) represent unused values in the observation\n\n3. Base reward calculation:\n   `reward = 1.0 - abs(angle) - 0.5 * abs(x)`\n   - Starts with a maximum reward of 1.0\n   - Subtracts the absolute value of the angle (penalizes for tilting)\n   - Subtracts half the absolute value of the x position (penalizes for moving away from the center)\n\n4. Penalty for extreme states:\n   ```python\n   if abs(angle) > 0.2 or abs(x) > 2.4:\n       reward -= 10\n   ```\n   - If the angle is greater than 0.2 radians (about 11.5 degrees) in either direction\n   - Or if the cart is more than 2.4 units away from the center\n   - A large penalty of 10 is applied\n\n5. Return the calculated reward\n\nThe logic behind this reward function is:\n\n1. Encourage keeping the pole upright: The more vertical the pole (smaller angle), the higher the reward.\n2. Encourage keeping the cart near the center: The closer to the center (smaller x), the higher the reward.\n3. Penalize extreme states: If the pole tilts too much or the cart moves too far from the center, apply a large penalty.\n\nThis reward structure guides the learning algorithm to find a policy that keeps the pole balanced and the cart centered. The specific values (0.2, 2.4, 10) are likely tuned based on the particular environment setup and desired behavior."}}
