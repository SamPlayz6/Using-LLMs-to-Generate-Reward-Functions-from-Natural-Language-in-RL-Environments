## Key Observations

1. **Dramatic Performance Advantage**:
   - The adaptive reward approach achieves rewards that are orders of magnitude higher than the other approaches
   - In Environment 1, adaptive reward is ~6-7 times better than other approaches
   - In Environment 2, after adaptation, the advantage grows to ~300 times better

2. **Increasing Advantage After Environment Change**:
   - The performance gap widens significantly after the environment changes
   - The adaptive reward approach shows continuous improvement throughout the experiment
   - Other approaches maintain relatively constant (and low) performance

3. **Rapid Adaptation**:
   - Adaptive reward approach shows quick recovery from environment changes (avg 2.0 episodes)
   - Despite showing fast adaptation, the PBRS approach doesn't achieve high performance

4. **Statistical Significance**:
   - Performance differences are statistically significant across all runs
   - All pairwise comparisons between adaptive reward and other approaches show significance

This data confirms that the adaptive reward approach significantly outperforms all other approaches, with especially dramatic performance gains after environmental changes.
