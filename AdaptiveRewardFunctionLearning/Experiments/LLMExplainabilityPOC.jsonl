This stability reward function is designed to encourage the cart-pole system to maintain a stable, upright position. Let's break down the components and explain how they contribute to the goal of stability:\n\n1. Input:\n   - The function takes two parameters: `observation` and `action`.\n   - The `observation` is unpacked into four variables: `x`, `xDot`, `angle`, and `angleDot`.\n   - `x`: Position of the cart\n   - `xDot`: Velocity of the cart\n   - `angle`: Angle of the pole from vertical\n   - `angleDot`: Angular velocity of the pole\n\n2. Angle Stability Component:\n   ```python\n   angle_stability = 1.0 - abs(angle) / 0.209\n   ```\n   - This component focuses on keeping the pole as close to vertical as possible.\n   - `abs(angle)` gives the absolute value of the angle, ensuring symmetrical treatment for both positive and negative angles.\n   - 0.209 radians is approximately 12 degrees, which is often used as the failure threshold in cart-pole problems.\n   - As the absolute angle approaches 0 (vertical), this component approaches 1 (maximum reward).\n   - As the absolute angle approaches 0.209, this component approaches 0 (minimum reward).\n\n3. Angular Velocity Component:\n   ```python\n   angular_velocity_component = -abs(angleDot) / 10.0\n   ```\n   - This component discourages rapid changes in the pole's angle.\n   - `abs(angleDot)` gives the absolute value of the angular velocity.\n   - The negative sign means this component always reduces the reward.\n   - Dividing by 10.0 scales this component to have less impact than the angle stability component.\n   - Larger angular velocities result in larger penalties, encouraging smoother movements.\n\n4. Combined Reward:\n   ```python\n   return float(angle_stability + angular_velocity_component)\n   ```\n   - The final reward is the sum of these two components.\n   - The `float()` function ensures the return value is a floating-point number.\n\nWhy this function focuses on stability:\n\n1. Angle-centric: The function primarily rewards keeping the pole close to vertical, which is the core challenge in the cart-pole problem.\n\n2. Smooth motion: By penalizing high angular velocities, it encourages smooth, controlled movements rather than erratic oscillations.\n\n3. Ignores cart position and velocity: The function doesn't consider `x` or `xDot`, focusing solely on the pole's behavior. This emphasizes keeping the pole upright regardless of where the cart is on the track.\n\n4. Bounded reward: The reward is designed to stay within a reasonable range, typically between -1 and 1, which is often desirable in reinforcement learning.\n\n5. Continuous feedback: The reward provides continuous feedback based on the pole's angle and angular velocity, rather than just a binary success/failure signal.\n\nBy focusing on these aspects, the reward function guides the learning algorithm towards policies that prioritize keeping the pole balanced and stable, which is the primary objective in the cart-pole problem."}}

Why it focuses on stability:\n   - The function only considers the angle and angular velocity of the pole, ignoring the cart's position and velocity.\n   - It rewards small angles (keeping the pole upright) and small angular velocities (minimizing oscillations).\n   - These factors directly contribute to the stability of the pole, regardless of where the cart is or how it's moving horizontally.\n\n6. What it doesn't consider:\n   - Cart position (`x`): The function doesn't care where the cart is on the track.\n   - Cart velocity (`xDot`): The speed of the cart doesn't affect the reward.\n\nIn summary, this reward function is focused on stability because it exclusively rewards keeping the pole upright (small angle) and minimizing its movement (small angular velocity), which are the key factors in maintaining a stable, balanced pole. The cart's movement is not factored into the reward, emphasizing that the primary goal is the pole's stability rather than the cart's position or motion."}}
