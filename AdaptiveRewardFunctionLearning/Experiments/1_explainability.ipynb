    "Stability Reward Function Explanation:\n",
    "Certainly! This stability reward function is designed to encourage the cart-pole system to maintain a stable, upright position. Let's break down the components and explain how they contribute to the goal of stability:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Input:\n",
    "   - The function takes two parameters: `observation` and `action`.\n",
    "   - `observation` is unpacked into four variables: `x`, `xDot`, `angle`, and `angleDot`.\n",
    "   - `x`: Position of the cart\n",
    "   - `xDot`: Velocity of the cart\n",
    "   - `angle`: Angle of the pole from vertical\n",
    "   - `angleDot`: Angular velocity of the pole\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Angle Stability Component:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   angle_stability = 1.0 - abs(angle) / 0.209\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - This component focuses on keeping the pole as close to vertical as possible.\n",
    "   - `abs(angle)` gives the absolute value of the angle, ensuring symmetrical treatment for both positive and negative angles.\n",
    "   - 0.209 radians is approximately 12 degrees, which is often used as a termination condition in cart-pole problems.\n",
    "   - The subtraction from 1.0 inverts the scale, so smaller angles result in higher rewards.\n",
    "   - This component will be 1.0 when the pole is perfectly vertical (angle = 0) and approach 0 as the angle nears Â±0.209 radians.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Angular Velocity Component:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   angular_velocity_component = -abs(angleDot) / 10.0\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - This component discourages rapid changes in the pole's angle.\n",
    "   - `abs(angleDot)` gives the absolute magnitude of the angular velocity.\n",
    "   - The negative sign ensures that faster angular velocities result in larger penalties (smaller rewards).\n",
    "   - Division by 10.0 scales this component to be in a similar range as the angle stability component.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Combination:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   return float(angle_stability + angular_velocity_component)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - The function returns the sum of these two components.\n",
    "   - This combination encourages both a vertical pole position and minimal angular velocity.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Focus on Stability:\n",
    "   - The function ignores the cart's position (`x`) and velocity (`xDot`), focusing solely on the pole's angle and angular velocity.\n",
    "   - This design prioritizes keeping the pole upright over the cart's position on the track.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Why it works for stability:\n",
    "   - Highest rewards are given when the pole is vertical (angle near 0) and not moving quickly (low angular velocity).\n",
    "   - As the pole deviates from vertical or starts moving faster, the reward decreases.\n",
    "   - This incentivizes actions that keep the pole upright and still, which is the essence of stability in the cart-pole system.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, this reward function is tailored specifically for stability by rewarding a vertical pole position and penalizing both angle deviations and rapid angular movements. It disregards the cart's horizontal motion, emphasizing the pole's stability above all else.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. Input:\n",

      "   - `angle`: Angle of the pole from vertical\n",
      "   - `angleDot`: Angular velocity of the pole\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Angle Stability Component:\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   angle_stability = 1.0 - abs(angle) / 0.209\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "   - This component focuses on the angle of the pole.\n",
      "   - The absolute value of the angle is used to treat deviations in both directions equally.\n",
      "   - 0.209 radians is approximately 12 degrees, which is often used as the failure threshold in cart-pole problems.\n",
      "   - As the angle approaches 0 (vertical position), this component approaches 1 (maximum reward).\n",
      "   - As the angle approaches Â±0.209 radians, this component approaches 0 (minimum reward).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Angular Velocity Component:\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   angular_velocity_component = -abs(angleDot) / 10.0\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "   - This component focuses on the angular velocity of the pole.\n",
      "   - The negative sign means that faster angular velocities result in lower rewards.\n",
      "   - The absolute value is used to penalize both clockwise and counterclockwise rotations equally.\n",
      "   - Dividing by 10.0 scales this component to have less impact than the angle stability component.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Combining Components:\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   return float(angle_stability + angular_velocity_component)\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "   - The two components are added together to produce the final reward.\n",
      "   - The `float()` function ensures the result is a floating-point number.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why this function focuses on stability:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Angle-based reward: By rewarding smaller angles, the function encourages the pole to stay close to vertical.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Angular velocity penalty: By penalizing higher angular velocities, the function discourages rapid swinging or oscillations of the pole.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Ignoring cart position and velocity: By not including `x` and `xDot` in the calculation, the function focuses solely on the pole's stability, regardless of where the cart is on the track.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Continuous reward: Instead of a binary reward (e.g., 1 for upright, 0 for fallen), this function provides a continuous range of values, allowing for more nuanced feedback during learning.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Bounded reward: The reward is designed to stay within a reasonable range, typically between -1 and 1, which is often beneficial for learning algorithms.\n",
      "\n",
      "By focusing on these specific aspects of stability (angle and angular velocity), the reward function guides the learning algorithm towards solutions that keep the pole balanced and minimize oscillations, which are key objectives in the cart-pole problem.\n",

    "\n",
    "Key changes and explanations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Increased emphasis on stability:\n",
    "   - Increased weight for theta (w_theta) from 1.0 to 2.0\n",
    "   - Increased weight for theta_dot (w_theta_dot) from 0.5 to 1.5\n",
    "   - Decreased weights for x and x_dot to shift focus to pole stability\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Modified gaussian functions for smoother rewards:\n",
    "   - Widened the gaussian for x (0.5 instead of 0.1) to be more lenient on cart position\n",
    "   - Narrowed the gaussian for theta (0.2 instead of 0.5) to be stricter on pole angle\n",
    "   - Adjusted gaussians for x_dot and theta_dot for better balance\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Normalized the final reward to ensure it stays in the [0, 1] range, making it easier to interpret and use in learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "These changes should result in a reward function that places higher importance on keeping the pole upright and stable, while being more forgiving of the cart's exact position. This should lead to improved stability in the pole balancing task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Waiting 10 seconds before critic evaluation...\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting critic's evaluation...\n",
    "\n",
    "Critic Response:\n",
    "1. The function is properly named 'reward_function_1', which is clear and distinct.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The reward calculations appear mathematically sound. The use of Gaussian-like functions for smoother transitions is a good approach, and the normalization of the final reward to the [0, 1] range is appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The function focuses appropriately on stability, particularly emphasizing the pole angle and angular velocity. This is achieved through increased weights for theta and theta_dot, and decreased weights for cart position and velocity.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Potential issues:\n",
    "   - The function might be overly lenient on cart position, which could lead to the cart drifting too far from the center.\n",
    "   - The narrowed Gaussian for theta might make the task too difficult initially, potentially slowing down learning.\n",
    "   - The weights and Gaussian parameters are somewhat arbitrary and might need fine-tuning based on empirical results.\n",
    "   - There's no explicit penalty for failure states (e.g., pole falling past a certain angle), which might be beneficial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the function seems well-designed for its purpose, but may require some empirical testing and potential adjustments.\n",
