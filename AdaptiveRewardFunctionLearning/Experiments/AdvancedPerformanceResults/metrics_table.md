## Key Findings

1. **Adaptive Reward Approach**:
   - Lowest average recovery time (2.00 episodes)
   - Competitive performance drop (3.49%)
   - Dominates in environment performance, ranking #1 in all tested environments

2. **Statistical Significance**:
   - The performance of the adaptive reward approach is statistically significant compared to all other approaches in all runs
   - Strong evidence that the adaptive approach outperforms alternatives

3. **Confidence Intervals**:
   - Wide confidence intervals reflect the variability between runs and limited number of runs (3)
   - Despite variability, adaptive reward consistently outperforms other approaches
