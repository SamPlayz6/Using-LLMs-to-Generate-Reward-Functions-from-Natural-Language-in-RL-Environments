      "\n",

      "a) The quadratic scaling of the angle reward might be too aggressive for very small angles, potentially leading to unstable behavior near the equilibrium point.\n",

      "b) The position penalty is linear, which might not sufficiently discourage the cart from moving too far from the center.\n",

      "c) The failure condition penalty (-10.0) might be too severe compared to the other reward components, potentially leading to overly conservative behavior.\n",
