    "Stability Reward Function Explanation:\n",
    "Certainly! This stability reward function is designed to encourage the cart-pole system to maintain a stable, upright position. Let's break down the components and explain how they contribute to the goal of stability:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Input:\n",
    "   - The function takes two parameters: `observation` and `action`.\n",
    "   - `observation` is unpacked into four variables: `x`, `xDot`, `angle`, and `angleDot`.\n",
    "   - `x`: Position of the cart\n",
    "   - `xDot`: Velocity of the cart\n",
    "   - `angle`: Angle of the pole from vertical\n",
    "   - `angleDot`: Angular velocity of the pole\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Angle Stability Component:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   angle_stability = 1.0 - abs(angle) / 0.209\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - This component focuses on keeping the pole as close to vertical as possible.\n",
    "   - `abs(angle)` gives the absolute value of the angle, ensuring symmetrical treatment for both positive and negative angles.\n",
    "   - 0.209 radians is approximately 12 degrees, which is often used as a termination condition in cart-pole problems.\n",
    "   - The subtraction from 1.0 inverts the scale, so smaller angles result in higher rewards.\n",
    "   - This component will be 1.0 when the pole is perfectly vertical (angle = 0) and approach 0 as the angle nears Â±0.209 radians.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Angular Velocity Component:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   angular_velocity_component = -abs(angleDot) / 10.0\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - This component discourages rapid changes in the pole's angle.\n",
    "   - `abs(angleDot)` gives the absolute magnitude of the angular velocity.\n",
    "   - The negative sign ensures that faster angular velocities result in larger penalties (smaller rewards).\n",
    "   - Division by 10.0 scales this component to be in a similar range as the angle stability component.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Combination:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   return float(angle_stability + angular_velocity_component)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - The function returns the sum of these two components.\n",
    "   - This combination encourages both a vertical pole position and minimal angular velocity.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Focus on Stability:\n",
    "   - The function ignores the cart's position (`x`) and velocity (`xDot`), focusing solely on the pole's angle and angular velocity.\n",
    "   - This design prioritizes keeping the pole upright over the cart's position on the track.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Why it works for stability:\n",
    "   - Highest rewards are given when the pole is vertical (angle near 0) and not moving quickly (low angular velocity).\n",
    "   - As the pole deviates from vertical or starts moving faster, the reward decreases.\n",
    "   - This incentivizes actions that keep the pole upright and still, which is the essence of stability in the cart-pole system.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, this reward function is tailored specifically for stability by rewarding a vertical pole position and penalizing both angle deviations and rapid angular movements. It disregards the cart's horizontal motion, emphasizing the pole's stability above all else.\n",

      "Stability Reward Function Explanation:\n",
      "Certainly! This stability reward function is designed to encourage the agent to keep the pole balanced upright and as stable as possible. Let's break down the components and explain their purpose:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Input:\n",
      "   - The function takes two parameters: `observation` and `action`.\n",
      "   - The `observation` is unpacked into four variables: `x`, `xDot`, `angle`, and `angleDot`.\n",
      "   - `x`: Position of the cart\n",
      "   - `xDot`: Velocity of the cart\n",
      "   - `angle`: Angle of the pole (in radians)\n",
      "   - `angleDot`: Angular velocity of the pole\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Angle Stability Component:\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   angle_stability = 1.0 - abs(angle) / 0.209\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "   - This component focuses on keeping the pole upright.\n",
      "   - The absolute value of the angle is used to treat deviations in both directions equally.\n",
      "   - 0.209 radians is approximately 12 degrees, which might be considered the maximum allowable angle before failure.\n",
      "   - When the angle is 0 (perfectly upright), this component will be 1.0 (maximum reward).\n",
      "   - As the angle increases, the reward decreases linearly, reaching 0 when the angle is at its maximum (0.209 radians).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Angular Velocity Component:\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   angular_velocity_component = -abs(angleDot) / 10.0\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "   - This component discourages rapid changes in the pole's angle.\n",
      "   - The absolute value of `angleDot` is used to penalize both clockwise and counterclockwise angular velocities.\n",
      "   - Dividing by 10.0 scales the penalty to be in a similar range as the angle stability component.\n",
      "   - The negative sign makes this a penalty: higher angular velocities result in lower (more negative) rewards.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Final Reward:\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   return float(angle_stability + angular_velocity_component)\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "   - The final reward is the sum of these two components.\n",
      "   - This encourages the agent to find a balance between keeping the pole upright and minimizing its angular velocity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why this function focuses on stability:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. It ignores the cart's position (`x`) and velocity (`xDot`), focusing solely on the pole's angle and angular velocity.\n",
      "2. The highest reward is achieved when the pole is perfectly upright (angle = 0) and not moving (angleDot = 0).\n",
      "3. It penalizes both the deviation from the upright position and rapid changes in angle, both of which are indicators of instability.\n",
      "\n",
      "By using this reward function, the agent is encouraged to learn actions that keep the pole as close to vertical as possible while also minimizing any rapid or excessive movements of the pole. This directly translates to maintaining stability in the pole balancing task.\n",

    "Key changes and explanations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Increased emphasis on stability:\n",
    "   - Increased weight for theta (w_theta) from 1.0 to 2.0\n",
    "   - Increased weight for theta_dot (w_theta_dot) from 0.5 to 1.5\n",
    "   - Decreased weights for x and x_dot to shift focus to pole stability\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Modified gaussian functions for smoother rewards:\n",
    "   - Widened the gaussian for x (0.5 instead of 0.1) to be more lenient on cart position\n",
    "   - Narrowed the gaussian for theta (0.2 instead of 0.5) to be stricter on pole angle\n",
    "   - Adjusted gaussians for x_dot and theta_dot for better balance\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Normalized the final reward to ensure it stays in the [0, 1] range, making it easier to interpret and use in learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "These changes should result in a reward function that places higher importance on keeping the pole upright and stable, while being more forgiving of the cart's exact position. This should lead to improved stability in the pole balancing task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Waiting 10 seconds before critic evaluation...\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting critic's evaluation...\n",
    "\n",
    "Critic Response:\n",
    "1. The function is properly named 'reward_function_1', which is clear and distinct.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The reward calculations appear mathematically sound. The use of Gaussian-like functions for smoother transitions is a good approach, and the normalization of the final reward to the [0, 1] range is appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The function focuses appropriately on stability, particularly emphasizing the pole angle and angular velocity. This is achieved through increased weights for theta and theta_dot, and decreased weights for cart position and velocity.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Potential issues:\n",
    "   - The function might be overly lenient on cart position, which could lead to the cart drifting too far from the center.\n",
    "   - The narrowed Gaussian for theta might make the task too difficult initially, potentially slowing down learning.\n",
    "   - The weights and Gaussian parameters are somewhat arbitrary and might need fine-tuning based on empirical results.\n",
    "   - There's no explicit penalty for failure states (e.g., pole falling past a certain angle), which might be beneficial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the function seems well-designed for its purpose, but may require some empirical testing and potential adjustments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision: Yes\n",
    "\n",
    "Critic Decision: Approved"

      "\n",
      "Key changes and explanations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Increased emphasis on stability:\n",
      "   - Increased weight for theta (w_theta) from 1.0 to 2.0\n",
      "   - Increased weight for theta_dot (w_theta_dot) from 0.5 to 1.5\n",
      "   - Decreased weights for x and x_dot to shift focus to pole stability\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Modified gaussian functions for smoother rewards:\n",
      "   - Widened the gaussian for x (0.5 instead of 0.1) to be more lenient on cart position\n",
      "   - Narrowed the gaussian for theta (0.2 instead of 0.5) to be stricter on pole angle\n",
      "   - Adjusted gaussians for x_dot and theta_dot for better balance\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Normalized the final reward to ensure it stays in the [0, 1] range, making it easier to interpret and use in learning algorithms.\n",
      "\n",
      "These changes should result in a reward function that places higher importance on keeping the pole upright and stable, while being more forgiving of the cart's exact position. This should lead to improved stability in the pole balancing task.\n",
      "\n",
      "Waiting 10 seconds before critic evaluation...\n",
      "\n",
      "Getting critic's evaluation...\n",
      "\n",
      "Critic Response:\n",
      "1. The function is properly named 'reward_function_1', which is clear and distinct.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The reward calculations appear mathematically sound. The use of Gaussian-like functions for smoother transitions is a good approach, and the normalization of the final reward to the [0, 1] range is appropriate.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The function focuses appropriately on stability, particularly emphasizing the pole angle and angular velocity. This is achieved through increased weights for theta and theta_dot, and decreased weights for cart position and velocity.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Potential issues:\n",
      "   - The function might be overly lenient on cart position, which could lead to the cart drifting too far from the center.\n",
      "   - The narrowed Gaussian for theta might make the task too difficult initially, potentially slowing down learning.\n",
      "   - The weights and Gaussian parameters are somewhat arbitrary and might need fine-tuning based on empirical results.\n",
      "   - There's no explicit penalty for failure states (e.g., pole falling past a certain angle), which might be beneficial.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the function seems well-designed for its purpose, but may require some empirical testing and potential adjustments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Decision: Yes\n",
      "\n",
      "Critic Decision: Approved\n",
      "\n",
